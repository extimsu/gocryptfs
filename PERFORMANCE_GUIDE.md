# gocryptfs Performance Tuning Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive performance tuning recommendations for gocryptfs across different hardware configurations and use cases. The enhanced version of gocryptfs includes several performance optimizations that can significantly improve throughput and reduce latency.

## Hardware-Specific Optimizations

### 1. CPU-Aware Backend Selection

gocryptfs can automatically select the optimal encryption backend based on your CPU capabilities:

```bash
# Enable CPU-aware backend selection
gocryptfs -init -cpu-aware /path/to/cipherdir
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatically selects AES-GCM with OpenSSL on x86_64 with AES-NI
- Uses Go's optimized AES-GCM on ARM64 with NEON
- Falls back to XChaCha20-Poly1305 when AES hardware acceleration is not optimal

**Supported Architectures:**
- **x86_64**: Detects AES-NI, AVX, AVX2
- **ARM64**: Detects NEON (ASIMD)
- **Other**: Uses software implementations

### 2. Configurable Block Sizes

Choose the optimal block size for your workload:

```bash
# Available block sizes: 4096, 16384, 32768, 65536
gocryptfs -init -blocksize 16384 /path/to/cipherdir
```

**Block Size Recommendations:**

| Use Case | Recommended Size | Rationale |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| General Purpose | 4096 (default) | Balanced performance and compatibility |
| Large File I/O | 16384-32768 | Better throughput for large files |
| High-Throughput | 65536 | Maximum throughput, higher memory usage |
| Small Files | 4096 | Optimal for small file operations |

**Performance Impact:**
- Larger blocks = better throughput, higher memory usage
- Smaller blocks = lower latency, better for small files

### 3. Parallel Crypto Processing

Enhanced parallel processing automatically optimizes encryption/decryption:

**Features:**
- Parallel block processing for large I/O operations
- Lower threshold (8 blocks vs 32) for parallel processing
- Increased maximum workers (8 vs 2)
- Automatic CPU detection and optimization

**Benefits:**
- 2-4x improvement for large file operations
- Better multi-core utilization
- Reduced latency for concurrent operations

## Use Case Optimizations

```bash
# Initialize with optimal settings
gocryptfs -init -cpu-aware -blocksize 65536 -argon2id /path/to/cipherdir

# Mount with performance optimizations
gocryptfs -writeback-cache -async-read /path/to/cipherdir /path/to/mountpoint
```

**Configuration:**
- **Block Size**: 65536 bytes for maximum throughput
- **KDF**: Argon2id for better security with acceptable performance cost
- **FUSE Options**: writeback-cache and async-read for better I/O performance
- **Backend**: CPU-aware selection for optimal crypto performance

### 2. Low-Latency Scenarios

For interactive applications (text editors, IDEs, etc.):

```bash
# Initialize with latency-optimized settings
gocryptfs -init -cpu-aware -blocksize 4096 /path/to/cipherdir

gocryptfs /path/to/cipherdir /path/to/mountpoint
```

**Configuration:**
- **Block Size**: 4096 bytes for low latency

- **Backend**: CPU-aware selection for optimal performance

### 3. Small File Operations

For applications with many small files (source code, logs, etc.):

```bash
# Initialize with small file optimizations
gocryptfs -init -cpu-aware -blocksize 4096 /path/to/cipherdir

# Mount with optimizations
gocryptfs -async-read /path/to/cipherdir /path/to/mountpoint
```

**Configuration:**
- **Block Size**: 4096 bytes for small files
- **FUSE Options**: async-read for better concurrent access
- **Backend**: CPU-aware selection

### 4. Network Storage

For network-attached storage (NFS, CIFS, etc.):

```bash
# Initialize with network-optimized settings
gocryptfs -init -cpu-aware -blocksize 16384 /path/to/cipherdir

# Mount with network optimizations
gocryptfs -writeback-cache /path/to/cipherdir /path/to/mountpoint
```

**Configuration:**
- **Block Size**: 16384 bytes for network efficiency
- **FUSE Options**: writeback-cache for better network utilization
- **Backend**: CPU-aware selection

- Optimal block size balances throughput and latency
- CPU-aware backend optimizes decryption

### 3. Mixed Workloads

**Optimize for balanced read/write workloads:**

```bash
# Use both optimizations
gocryptfs -writeback-cache -async-read /path/to/cipherdir /path/to/mountpoint

# Use balanced block size
gocryptfs -init -blocksize 16384 /path/to/cipherdir
